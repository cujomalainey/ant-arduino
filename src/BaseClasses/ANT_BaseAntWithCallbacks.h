/**
 * This class can be used instead of the Ant class and allows
 * user-specified callback functions to be called when responses are
 * received, simplifying the processing code and reducing boilerplate.
 *
 * To use it, first register your callback functions using the onXxx
 * methods. Each method has a uintptr_t data argument, that can be used to
 * pass arbitrary data to the callback (useful when using the same
 * function for multiple callbacks, or have a generic function that can
 * behave differently in different circumstances). Supplying the data
 * parameter is optional, but the callback must always accept it (just
 * ignore it if it's unused). The uintptr_t type is an integer type
 * guaranteed to be big enough to fit a pointer (it is 16-bit on AVR,
 * 32-bit on ARM), so it can also be used to store a pointer to access
 * more data if required (using proper casts).
 *
 * There can be only one callback of each type registered at one time,
 * so registering callback overwrites any previously registered one. To
 * unregister a callback, pass NULL as the function.
 *
 * To ensure that the callbacks are actually called, call the loop()
 * method regularly (in your loop() function, for example). This takes
 * care of calling readPacket() and getResponse() other methods on the
 * Ant class, so there is no need to do so directly (though it should
 * not mess with this class if you do, it would only mean some callbacks
 * aren't called).
 *
 * Inside callbacks, you should generally not be blocking / waiting.
 * Since callbacks can be called from inside waitFor() and friends, a
 * callback that doesn't return quickly can mess up the waitFor()
 * timeout.
 *
 * Sending packets is not a problem inside a callback, but avoid
 * receiving a packet (e.g. calling readPacket(), loop() or waitFor()
 * and friends) inside a callback (since that would overwrite the
 * current response, messing up any pending callbacks and waitFor() etc.
 * methods already running).
